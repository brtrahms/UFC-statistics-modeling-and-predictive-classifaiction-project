# UFC-statistics-modeling-and-predictive-classifaiction-project

## Overview
UFC statistics analysis and modeling project aimed at applying data modeling to accuartely predict UFC fight outcomes. I did my analysis, training, and validation on historical MMA fight data from 1993 to 2021. I then tested the resulting models on Fight Night: Aldo vs Font and UFC 269.

### Historical Data

## Conclusions
I believe this application to be hard do to the large number of variables at play along and the relative small size of the datasets. A larger test set would help to better know the true accuracy of the model, but I don't see the winner predictor breaking 60% accuracy consistently and the win_by predictor breaking 40% consistently.
